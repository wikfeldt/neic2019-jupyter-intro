    "- Notebooks don't encourage modular code development\n",
    " - Solution: When you find yourself copy-pasting between notebooks, split code into modules and import them in notebook.\n",
    "- Difficult to test well\n",
    " - Solution: Include lots of mini-tests and assertions, and split into testable modules.\n",
    "- Historically not easy to version control\n",
    " - Solution: install [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the Git integration to JupyterLab.\n",
    "- Hidden state hampers reproducibility\n",
    " - Solution: Use \"Restart and run all\" regularly (although this defeats the purpuse of keeping results in memory).\n",
    "- Notebooks aren't named by default and their purpose tends to drift\n",
    " - Solution: Name notebooks well, and take time to sort code well when you notice feature drifting.\n",
    "- Difficult to integrate into other execution systems\n",
    " - Solution: Same as for modular code. Use notebooks to explore, scripts to run in bulk."
